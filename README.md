# Project-Progress-Monitoring-Service-Using-Geospatial-Server

The Project Progress Monitoring Service enable users to verify the status of their projects online
and serves as an operational tool to run their organisation effectively for both operators and
clients. it monitored and analysed project development data in real time. 
In the past, significant global efforts were undertaken to accomplish this objective and practically execute it for usage
by stakeholders and project managers. There was a definite need for a real-time system that
could track project progress effectively and precisely using server technology and geospatial
data. The system was comprised of key modules, including data collection, geospatial analysis,
progress tracking, and reporting. Through the system, project progress was monitored using
historical and real-time data, allowing for timely identification of any issues or delays. The
geospatial server technology enabled accurate tracking and visualization of project milestones,
providing a complete view of the project's status. The developed system is a visually appealing
and user-friendly dashboard that presented the project progress in a clear and concise manner.
The dashboard provided a comprehensive overview of IQC, EQC, and FQC metrics, enabling
stakeholders to assess the project's status and identify areas that required attention or
improvement. Through the dashboard, users could visualize spatial data, track progress over
time, and generate reports based on the collected data. It can be support multiple project
monitoring in future as for now it monitor only one project at a time.
